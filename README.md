# MACHINE-LEARNING-EMPOWERED-CLASSIFICATION-OF-UNIVERSITY-EXAM-QUESTIONS-VIA-BLOOM-S-TAXONOMY

The purpose of this research was to design a machine learning model that would enable the identification of university examination questions according to Bloom’s Taxonomy. In the research collected a dataset of 2100 exam questions from South Eastern University and the data was pre-processed and features were extracted from the textual data by applying natural language processing techniques such as TF-IDF transformation and similar to that made text data easily understandable by the machine learning algorithm. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) was established, both of which possessed high scores. The outcomes confirmed that the models can accurately classify questions in line with the cognitive stages identified. Implicitly, the study proved that machine learning may be used in the improvement of educational assessments and indicate to educator’s ways they could give better balanced comprehensive examinations. This work addressed the study objectives by constructing a solid and suitable data set, formulating suitable models using machine learning techniques, and designing an educator tool. I believe that this work contributes to the field of education due to its objective to provide efficient solutions to automate assessments and promote adaptive learning solutions.
